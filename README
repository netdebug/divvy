Divvy
=====

Divvy implements Shamir's secret sharing scheme.  It provides a library for
splitting and combining secrets and frontend tools to do the same.

Examples
--------

Divide a secret into 10 pieces such that any three may be used to reconstruct
the original secret:
    $ echo 'abc' | divvy -k 3 -n 10
    A_qxz6csQ_pj
    A5mDDtKYsOPg
    A3Y4TpzlbG0a
    A_u2C99_CznA
    A_eS_x7csv2M
    A5Sg7HLRfUCY
    A0C6Hkz9XXB4
    A3ocgVlEYfZb
    A4PFeo8ZCOEd
    Az7bfHATWo8D

Any three of these pieces may be combined to obtain the original secret:
    $ undivvy << EOF
    > A3Y4TpzlbG0a
    > A0C6Hkz9XXB4
    > A5mDDtKYsOPg
    > EOF
    abc

The implementation is 8-bit safe, so arbitrary binary files can be passed into
divvy and taken from undivvy.  The pieces are always URL base64 encoded.

To Install
----------

    apt-get install libbsd-dev
    autoreconf -ivf # (only needed if compiling from git, not tarball)
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

TODO
----

Currently there's minimal error checking on decode.  It won't detect if pieces
from different secrets are combined, or if the same piece is provided multiple
times.  This is probably a feature more than a bug as it keeps things simple
and prevents the additional metadata from leaking anything about the keys.
